•	Single handedly, performed research on bank dataset to find the most efficient and optimized solution to predict the factors that affected the customer retention rate using machine learning algorithms like Naïve Bayes, K-Means and SVM and neural networks in python.
•	Commensurate the accuracies of algorithms with code-generated graphs, which showed Neural networks as the best algorithm with 90% accuracy.
