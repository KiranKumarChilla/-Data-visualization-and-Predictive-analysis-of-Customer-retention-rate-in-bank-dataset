The listed files include  
  1. project report has detailed analysis of dataset and information related to implementation.
  2. Comparison of Accuracy.PNG has comparison of accuracies generated by implementing different machine learning algorithms used. 
  3.Python codes(MLProject.py includes implementation of K-means,SVM and Naive bayes,neuralnetworks.py has implementation of neural             networks) 

=> Single handedly, performed research on bank dataset to find 
   1. factors affecting customer retention rate
   2. most efficient and optimized solution to predict the factors by using results generated from various machine learning                      algorithms like Naive Bayes, K-Means, SVM and neural networks.
=> Commensurate the accuracies of algorithms with code-generated graphs, which showed Neural networks as the best algorithm with maximum      accuracy.
=> Software/Tools Used: Python, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Spyder IDE, SciPy, matplotlib; 
   Dataset used is available at  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing
